        <h1>Censorship</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Censorship in survival-time (time-to-event, failure-time) studies refers to incomplete data.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Examples of incomplete data are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>individual still alive (no event) at end of study</li>
            <li>individual lost to follow up or left study before the end</li>
            <li>event not recorded properly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...in these situations the lack of completeness of data exists at the end of the study, a situation more strictly known as right censorship. Censorship in StatsDirect is used to mean right censorship.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Coding for censorship in StatsDirect is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>0 for censored data (no event observed)</li>
            <li>≥1 for uncensored data (e.g. 1 for an individual event/death at a time point, 2 for 2 events etc. - note that 2 events can be expressed either in a single row with 2 in the censorship column or in two rows with 1 in the censorship column)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If there are problems with your data at the start of a study (e.g. start time not recorded properly) then the data are left censored. Left censored data are best avoided or dealt with by specialist Statisticians.</p>
