        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bias is a systematic error that leads to an incorrect estimate of effect or association. Many factors can bias the results of a study such that they cancel out, reduce or amplify a real effect you are trying to describe.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Epidemiology categorises types of bias, examples are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Selection bias - e.g. study of car ownership in central London is not representative of the UK.</li>
            <li>Observation bias (recall and information) - e.g. on questioning, healthy people are more likely to under report their alcohol intake than people with a disease.</li>
            <li>Observation bias (interviewer) - e.g. different interviewer styles might provoke different responses to the same question.</li>
            <li>Observation bias (misclassification) - tends to dilute an effect</li>
            <li>Losses to follow up - e.g. ill people may not feel able to continue with a study whereas health people tend to complete it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Some strategies to combat bias:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>multiple control groups</li>
            <li>standardised observations (e.g. blinding (don't know if placebo or active intervention) of subject, observer, both subject and observer (double blind) or subject, observer and analyst (triple blind))</li>
            <li>corroboration of multiple information sources</li>
            <li>use of dummy variables with known associations</li>
        </ul>
