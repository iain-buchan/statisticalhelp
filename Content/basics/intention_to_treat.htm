        <p>Epidemiological studies are usually analysed on the basis of intention to treat because this reduces <a href="confounding.htm">confounding</a> due to non-random dropout from the study. The alternative approach is known as on treatment analysis.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Pros of intention to treat analysis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>reduces confounding due to non-random drop out or non-compliance with the intervention studied</li>
            <li>more pragmatic for answering real world questions because it is the effect of offering the treatment that is analysed as opposed to the effect of taking it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Cons of intention to treat analysis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>reduces statistical power and may thus fail to demonstrate a real effect (wash-in periods are sometimes used to minimise power loss by ensuring tolerability of the intervention and thus reducing non-compliance)</li>
        </ul>
