        <p>Epidemiology is the study of the <b>distribution and determinants of health-related states and events in specified populations</b>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>Epidemiologists use a rich language to describe how they apply statistical methods to the study of populations in order to work out, for example, the causes of diseases.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If a population is exposed to some factor, called the exposure, the Epidemiologists usually study the relationship between the exposure and relevant heath outcomes, for example cigarette smoking and lung cancer.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A very important question that Epidemiologists must ask themselves when thinking about a numerical association between some exposure(s) and outcome(s) is "how might I be wrong". The answer is by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="p_values.htm">Chance</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="bias.htm">Bias</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="confounding.htm">Confounding</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You should understand the basic concepts of <a href="causality.htm">causality</a>, chance, bias and confounding in order to start to work with epidemiological problems. You should also understand the basic principles of study design, for example <a href="prospective.htm">prospective vs. retrospective studies</a>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are several introductory text books, either under a cover title of Epidemiology or Statistics <a href="../references/reference_list.htm">(e.g. Bland 2000)</a> and <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~super1">web sites</a>.</p>
