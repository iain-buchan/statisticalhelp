        <p>The Studentized range, Q, is a statistic due to <a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Newman (1939)</a> and <a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Keuls (1952)</a> that is used in multiple comparison methods. Q is defined as the range of means divided by the estimated standard error of the mean for a set of samples being compared. The estimated standard error of the mean for a group of samples is usually derived from analysis of variance.</p>

        <p><u>Technical Validation</u>
        </p>
        <p>StatsDirect calculates tail areas and percentage points for a given number of samples and sample sizes (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Copenhaver and Holland, 1988</a>). These calculations are highly iterative therefore you may notice a delay during their computation. Other software and web sites might produce different results to StatsDirect; this is likely to be due to their use of less precise or more restricted algorithms (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Gleason, 1999; Lund and Lund, 1983; Royston, 1987</a>).</p>
