        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Many relationships between factors observed in the natural world are non-linear. A popular statistical approach to the study of these relationships is to <a href="../chi_square_tests/22.htm">transform</a> them so that they are approximately linear and therefore amenable to the well-established numerical methods of linear modelling. Linear transformation works well in many situations but is not possible in others.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A substantial problem with fitting transformed variables is that errors you assumed to be normal in the non-transformed variable become non-normal after transformation. In specific applications, such as <a href="probit_analysis.htm">probit analysis</a>, the error calculations have been designed for use with data that have a specified error distribution other than normal. It is not advisable to feed transformed variables through linear regression without a sound statistical argument for doing so. If you are confident of a particular model then you may be justified in using a generalised linear model method to fit your data. Examples of this are probit analysis and logistic regression. StatsDirect offers general <a href="logistic.htm">logistic regression</a> for dichotomous responses. <a href="http://www.sas.com">SAS</a> provides logistic regression for dichotomous and ordinal responses. <a href="http://www.nag.co.uk">GLIM</a> provides a broad range of generalised linear models. R and S+ provide more general modelling platforms.</p>

        <p>Non-linear statistical modelling is a highly complex subject that blends the instincts of experience with art and science. Seek the help of a Statistician if you wish to use non-linear methods.</p>
