        <p>Chi-square tests can be used to test the association between two classifications (classifier variables) of a set of counts or frequencies. This two dimensional arrangement is commonly displayed as a contingency table or cross classification where rows represent one variable and columns represent the other. The null hypothesis is that there is no association between the two variables.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The main assumption of this group of methods is that for any observation it can only belong to one cell in the contingency table.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Row and column totals (marginal totals) are used to predict what count would be expected for each cell if the null hypothesis were true. A test statistic which is approximately distributed as a chi-square variable is calculated from the observed and expected frequencies. The larger the test statistic (for given degrees of freedom) the more likely there is to be a statistically significant association between the two variables.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This group of methods is intended for medium to large samples. Cochrane's rule states that no expected frequency should be less than 1 and at least 80% of expected frequencies should be greater than 5 (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Bland, 2000</a>).</p>
