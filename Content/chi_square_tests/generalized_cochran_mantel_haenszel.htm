        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Three generalised tests for association between row and column classes are offered for stratified r by c tables produced in the crosstabs function when you specify a third (stratum, controlling for) classifier (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Agresti, 2002; Landis et al., 1978, 1979</a>).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The first test (ordinal association) assumes that there is meaningful order to both the columns and rows of each r by c table.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The second test (ordinal columns vs. nominal rows) assumes that there is meaningful order in the columns of each r by c table.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The third test (nominal association) does not assume any order in rows or columns; it provides a general test of association between the row and column classifiers.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The reliability of the tests increases with sample size, but unlike the Pearson chi-square statistic for single r by c tables, small counts in a few cells are unlikely to invalidate the tests.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You could control for more than one factor by making a stratum variable consisting of several factors (e.g. UK male, US male, UK female, US female to control for gender and country of residence).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note that there are other approaches to these analyses, namely ordinal and nominal logistic regression. You should consult with a statistician before using these methods in important studies.</p>

        <p><u>Data entry</u>
        </p>
        <p>Note the potentially confusing terminology over row and column scores: The 'row scores' are the scores associated with the column classification; these are applied to the entries (by column) in each row. The 'column scores' are the scores associated with the row classification; these are applied to the entries (by row) in each column.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><u>Example</u>
        </p>
        <p>From <a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Agresti (2002)</a>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The data can be found in the Tables worksheet of the Test workbook. Use the menu item Analysis_Crosstabs to generate a cross tabulation of the job satisfaction, income and gender variables. Use the row (income) scores as 3, 10, 20 and 35. Use the column (job satisfaction) scores as 1, 3, 4 and 5.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For this example:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><u>Generalised Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests</u>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Row variable (first classifier): Income</p>
        <p>Column variable (second classifier): Job Satisfaction</p>
        <p>Stratum variable (third classifier, controlling for): Gender</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Income scores: 3, 10, 20, 35</p>
        <p>Job Satisfaction scores: 1, 3, 4, 5</p>

            <tr>
                <td>Ordinal association</td>
                <td>6.156301</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>P = 0.0131</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Nominal rows vs. ordinal columns association</td>
                <td>9.034222</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>P = 0.0288</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Nominal association</td>
                <td>10.200089</td>
                <td>9</td>
                <td>P = 0.3345</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Sample size = 104</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>From the results above you can see that the strongest effect detected is ordinal association (i.e. association between greater job satisfaction with greater income), after controlling for gender.</p>
