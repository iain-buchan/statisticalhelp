        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The issue of "mid-P" values and confidence intervals is complex and frequently misunderstood. It arises only with discrete distributions (in StatsDirect with proportions and binomial distributions).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In short, "exact P" methods attempt to align alpha with the maximum type I error rate and 1-alpha with the minimum coverage, whereas "mid P" methods try to align alpha with the mean type I error rate and 1-alpha with the mean coverage. Remember that alpha = significance = probability of type I error and type I error = the false rejection of the null hypothesis (see <a href="../basics/p_values.htm">P</a>).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Statisticians do not agree universally upon when to use "mid P" methods. Armitage and Berry recommend using "mid P" methods when comparing several trials (e.g. 95% confidence intervals for the difference between two independent proportions from ten similar trials) and to use "exact P" methods when considering single trials in isolation.</p>
