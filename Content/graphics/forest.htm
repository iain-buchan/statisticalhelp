        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This plots a series of lines and symbols representing a meta-analysis or overview analysis.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>StatsDirect uses a line to represent the confidence interval of an effect (e.g. odds ratio) estimate. The effect estimate is marked with a solid black square. The size of the square represents the weight that the corresponding study exerts in the meta-analysis; this is the Mantel-Haenszel weight.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The pooled estimate is marked with an unfilled diamond that has an ascending dotted line from its upper point. Confidence intervals of pooled estimates are displayed as a horizontal line through the diamond; this line might be contained within the diamond if the confidence interval is narrow. You may define more than one pooled effect estimate to represent sub-groups (use a value &gt; 0 in the pooling indicator to do this).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To prepare a forest plot in StatsDirect you must first enter a list of effect estimates in a workbook. You must also prepare matching columns of lower and upper confidence limits. Thus we have three columns of equal length in a workbook for these data. You can also prepare a matching column of sample sizes or weights but this is optional.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A further optional column can be used to indicate which of the effect estimates and their confidence limits are pooled. A pooling indicator of 0 represents an individual study, &lt; 0 (e.g. -1) indicates an overall pooled result (there should be only one) and &gt; 0 (e.g. 1) indicates a pooled subgroup. If no pooling indicator variable is selected then all are assumed to be individual studies.</p>

        <p>This plot can be put to other uses. Please note that you can annotate it using an external presentation package such as Microsoft Powerpoint. To annotate a StatsDirect graph in Microsoft Word just <a href="../menus/copy.htm">copy</a> it from StatsDirect to Word using the clipboard and double click on it in Word.</p>

        <p>Note that <a href="../meta_analysis/labbe.htm">L'Abbé plots</a> can be more useful that the plots above for exploring the heterogeneity of effects in a meta-analysis (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Song, 1999</a>).</p>
