        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This function exports a selected graphical image in a report as a Windows metafile (*.wmf) vector drawing or as a bitmap file (Windows bitmap *.bmp, or compressed a) Portable Network Graphic/PNG *.png, b) Joint Photographic Expert Group/JPEG *.jpg).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If your graph has a very large number of data points then a Windows metafile can be very large because it is a series of drawing commands. More often the Windows metafile option will produce a smaller file that can be edited in external drawing software and scaled to size without any loss of quality.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For simple line graphics, PNG will generally produce better compression than JPEG.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If you want to edit charts after they have been drawn you can right click on them in the report and select "Replay Operation" from the pop-up menu.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If you want make manual changes to a chart with drawing tools then please open the report in Microsoft Word, right click on the chart and select "Edit Picture" from the pop-up menu.</p>
