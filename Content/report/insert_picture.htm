        <h1>Insert Picture</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The <b>Insert_Picture</b> menu function inserts a picture into the <a href="../menus/current_report_or_workbook.htm" target="_popup">current</a> report at the position where the cursor is flashing. The formats of picture that you can insert are Windows bitmap (bmp), Windows metafile (wmf), enhanced Windows metafile (emf), Compuserve graphics interchange format (gif) and joint photographic expert group (jpg, jpeg).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Windows metafiles are vector graphics whereas the other formats are bitmaps or compressions of bitmaps. Vector graphics files contain drawing commands that relate to a grid of co-ordinates. Bitmap graphics files contain data for each dot that makes up a picture. If you want to be able to scale pictures properly or to edit them as line drawings then you should use metafile graphics formats. StatsDirect graphics generate standard Windows metafiles. If you copy a StatsDirect graphic and paste it into Microsoft Word then you can double click on the graphic in Word to edit it using Word's integrated line drawing editor.</p>
