            Variance, Standard Deviation and Spread</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The standard deviation of the mean (SD) is the most commonly used measure of the spread of values in a distribution. SD is calculated as the square root of the variance (the average squared deviation from the mean).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Variance in a population is:</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:equation>$\displaystyle \sigma^2=\frac{\displaystyle \sum(x-\mu)^2}{n}$</MadCap:equation>
        </p>
        <p>[x is a value from the population, μ is the mean of all x, n is the number of x in the population, Σ is the summation]</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Variance is usually estimated from a sample drawn from a population. The unbiased estimate of population variance calculated from a sample is:</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:equation>$\displaystyle s^2=\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$</MadCap:equation>
        </p>
        <p>[x<sub>i</sub> is the ith observation from a sample of the population, x-bar is the sample mean, n (sample size) -1 is <a href="../basics/degrees_freedom.htm">degrees of freedom</a>, Σ is the summation]</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            The spread of a distribution is also referred to as dispersion and variability. All three terms mean the extent to which values in a distribution differ from one another.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>SD is the best measure of spread of an approximately normal distribution. This is not the case when there are extreme values in a distribution or when the distribution is skewed, in these situations interquartile range or semi-interquartile are preferred measures of spread. Interquartile range is the difference between the 25th and 75th centiles. Semi-interquartile range is half of the difference between the 25th and 75th centiles. For any symmetrical (not skewed) distribution, half of its values will lie one semi-interquartile range either side of the median, i.e. in the interquartile range. When distributions are approximately normal, SD is a better measure of spread because it is less susceptible to sampling fluctuation than (semi-)interquartile range.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If a variable y is a linear (y = a + bx) transformation of x then the variance of y is b² times the variance of x and the standard deviation of y is b times the variance of x.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            The standard error of the mean is the expected value of the standard deviation of means of several samples, this is estimated from a single sample as:</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:equation>$\displaystyle \text{SEM}=\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$</MadCap:equation>
        </p>
        <p>[s is standard deviation of the sample mean, n is the sample size]</p>
