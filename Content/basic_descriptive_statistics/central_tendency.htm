            The three common measures of central tendency of a distribution are the <a href="univariate_summary.htm">arithmetic mean</a>, the <a href="../nonparametric_methods/quantile_ci.htm">median</a> and the mode. Think of a distribution in terms of an histogram with many bars; a large sample from a normal distribution would describe a bell shaped curve that is symmetrical. In a perfectly symmetrical, non-<a href="skewness.htm">skewed</a> distribution the mean, median and mode are equal. As distributions become more skewed the difference between these different measures of central tendency gets larger.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The mode is the most commonly occurring value in a distribution, population or sample.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The mean (arithmetic mean) is the average (sum of observations / number of observations) in a distribution, sample or population. The mean is more sensitive to outliers than the median or mode.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The median is the middle value in a sorted distribution, sample or population. When there is an even number of observations the median is the mean of the two central values.</p>
