            Filter Worksheet Rows</h1>

        <p>Menu location: <b>Data_Organizing_Filter (On/Off)</b>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This function enables you to switch worksheet row filters on or off.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To switch row filters on first select the columns or ranges of cells that contain the data you want to filter then select this menu item.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When row filtering is switched on a funnel symbol appears at the top of each column or block of data to which the filter applies. Click on the funnel symbol to set filters. Check boxes will appear next to the categories that appear in the column. For example, if your column contains a variable for sex and the number "1" represents males then check the value "1" to select only males for analysis. After you have done this the rows with data on females will disappear. To get the female data back again click on the funnel and check the value for females, say "2", or just clear the filters by selecting this menu item again.</p>
