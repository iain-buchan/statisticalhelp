        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For large (50 or more observations) normally distributed samples,  <a href="../distributions/normal.htm">normal distribution</a>  tests are equivalent to Student t tests.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><u>Normal data</u>
        </p>
        <p>You may either compare the means of two independent random samples or compare the mean of one sample with a known population mean. Note that for large degrees of freedom, <a href="../distributions/t.htm">Student's t</a>  distribution is approximately normal (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Altman, 1991; Armitage and Berry, 1994</a>).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>See the examples for <a href="parametric_methods.htm">t tests</a>  and consider these in the context of larger samples.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You will gain a little more sensitivity by using a normal distribution test instead of its equivalent Student t test but you must have good reason to believe that your data have been drawn from a normal distribution. Student t tests are less sensitive than normal distribution tests to small deviations from normality; use t tests if you have any doubt. If your data are clearly non-normal then you should consider using a nonparametric alternative such as the <a href="../nonparametric_methods/wilcoxon_signed_ranks.htm">Wilcoxon signed ranks</a>  test or the <a href="../nonparametric_methods/mann_whitney.htm">Mann-Whitney</a> U test.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The single sample test statistic is calculated as:</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:equation>$\displaystyle z=\frac{\bar x-\mu}{\sqrt{s^2/n}}$</MadCap:equation>
        </p>
        <p>- where x bar is the sample mean, s² is the sample variance, n is the sample size, µ is the specified population mean and z is a quantile from the standard normal distribution.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The unpaired test statistic is calculated as:</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:equation>$\displaystyle z=\frac{\bar x_1 -\bar x_2}{\sqrt{\displaystyle \frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$</MadCap:equation>
        </p>
        <p>- where x-bar 1 and x-bar 2 are the sample means, s<sub>1</sub>² and s<sub>2</sub>² are the sample variances, n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are the sample sizes and z is a quantile from the standard normal distribution.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><u>Log-normal data</u>
        </p>
        <p>For samples from a log-normal distribution (logs from a normal distribution) you may wish to construct an interval analogous to the confidence interval for the mean of a sample from a normal distribution. StatsDirect gives you the geometric mean (arithmetic mean of logs) and a reference range as:</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:equation>$\displaystyle \exp(g \pm 2s) \\

\displaystyle g=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \ln(x_i) \\

\displaystyle s=\sqrt{\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \ln(x_i)^2- \frac{1}{n}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^n \ln(x_i)\right]^2 }{n-1}}$</MadCap:equation>
        </p>
        <p>- where g is geometric mean, ln is natural logarithm, n is sample size and z is a quantile from the standard normal distribution (alpha/2 quantile for a 100*(1-alpha)% confidence interval).</p>
