        <p>StatsDirect is sensitive to the symbols used to denote decimal places and to group long numbers into thousands.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Decimal separator symbol" />In international English, " . " is used as the "decimal point" or decimal separator symbol and " , " is sometimes used to group long numbers into thousands (e.g. 1,121,000). In some other locales, such as German, these symbols are transposed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Digit-grouping symbol" />You can set the decimal and digit-grouping symbols used on your computer under the Regional Options of Windows Control Panel. You MUST set the numeric options to be the same as the currency options for these two symbols - i.e. change both numeric and currency settings to have the same decimal and digit grouping symbols, otherwise many software applications, including StatsDirect, will not function properly.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Avoid using digit-grouping symbols when entering values.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When StatsDirect starts up, it looks to see what character set your system is using as default for input from your keyboard. Examples are Western, Greek, Cyrillic etc.. When you start a new workbook, the character set used is your system's default, provided that it is supported by StatsDirect, otherwise Western is used. To see which character set StatsDirect is using, select Help_About_StatsDirect.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You can change the character set of an individual workbook via the script setting in the Format_Default_Font menu item, but this will only affect the display of characters in that workbook. The character set of the test workbook that comes with StatsDirect is Western. Note that graphics labels are produced using the system default character set, so try not to use different character sets in your workbooks from the one shown when you select the menu item Help_About_StatsDirect.</p>
