        <p>The <b>Window</b> menu section deals with the arrangement of workbook and report windows within StatsDirect. Each report or workbook has its own window. You can have many reports and workbooks open at one time. The best way switch between windows within StatsDirect is to click on the relevant tabs toward the top of the main StatsDirect window. It is best to use workbook and report windows in a maximized state (click on the maximize button second from the top right hand corner to re-maximize a tiled or cascade window).</p>
