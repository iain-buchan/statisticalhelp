        <h1>New Workbook</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:keyword term="File" /><b>File_New Workbook</b> menu function starts a new StatsDirect workbook.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A workbook is a series of worksheets that have cells arranged into rows and columns, e.g. cell A3 is row 3 of the first column. You can switch between different worksheets within a workbook by clicking on the upside down tabs at the bottom of the workbook's window. Data are entered into the cells in the same way you would use spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A new workbook is shown in StatsDirect with a tab labelled "Book x" where x is the number of that workbook, e.g. x is 1 if the workbook you have started is the only workbook open. If you save the workbook with a file name then the tab attached to the workbook will be re-labelled with the name you chose to save it with. Tabs are displayed at the top of the StatsDirect window and they look like the tabs you would see in a filing cabinet. If you click on a tab then StatsDirect will display the workbook or report that is attached to it.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You can copy, cut and paste data between StatsDirect workbooks and many other Windows spreadsheet applications including Microsoft Excel. StatsDirect can read and write Microsoft Excel files and can link to Excel directly: see <a href="../basics/excel.htm">Excel links</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When you start a workbook it is based upon a template workbook. Select the menu option "Save Template" if you want to make a template for new StatsDirect workbooks. StatsDirect starts with a blank workbook as the template at installation. If you accidentally save an unwanted template then start a new sheet, select all, delete then save it as template using "Save Template".</p>
