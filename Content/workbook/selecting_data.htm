        <h1>Selecting Data from a Workbook</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To select a single column of data, move the mouse to the top of it and click with the left mouse button. The column should then be highlighted and this means that it is selected.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To select part of a column, drag the mouse over the required data with the left button held down.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To select a number of columns or parts of columns do either of the above procedures but with the control key, marked Ctrl, held down.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If StatsDirect asks you to select types of data described in a box at the top of the screen then you may click with the right mouse button to enter data once you have selected them. This will save you from having to move the mouse between the OK button at the top of the screen and the parts of the workbook you are selecting.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For StatsDirect functions which require data that are not requested explicitly as separate columns, e.g. unpaired t test or two way analysis of variance, you can highlight the data before you select the analysis.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Columns in a workbook usually hold data that belong to a variable that you need to identify when running many of the methods in StatsDirect. The exceptions to this are screen data functions, such as a chi-square test, which appear in the analysis menu even when there is no workbook loaded. You type the data for screen data directly into the forms shown on the screen. There is also a <a href="../basic_descriptive_statistics/crosstabs.htm">crosstabs</a> function for workbook columns to be cross-tabulated.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>N.B. 1: StatsDirect also works in a group identifier mode rather than a multiple column mode for selecting data, please see <a href="../menus/analysis_options.htm">analysis options</a> for a full description.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>N.B. 2: If you want to repeat a function for another set of data then you can use the <a href="../menus/batch_mode.htm">batch mode</a> option.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>N.B. 3: If the column that you are selecting contains categorical data then it is best to use a column title of at least four characters long. If the first entry in a selected range is unique and is four or more characters long then it is treated as a column title, otherwise it is treated as categorical data.</p>
