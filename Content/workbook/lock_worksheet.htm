        <h1>Lock Worksheet</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The <b>Format_Lock Sheet</b> menu function locks and unlocks the active worksheet for editing.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You may wish to lock an important worksheet in a workbook in order to prevent editing it in error. In these circumstances you may also wish to make a copy of the active worksheet and paste it into another worksheet in the current workbook for temporary editing. To select a whole sheet for copying just click on the top left hand cell at the label row and column intersection. If you need to insert a new worksheet then select 'Sheet' from the 'Insert' menu.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If there is a check mark by the entry 'Lock Worksheet' in the 'Format' section of the StatsDirect menu then the active worksheet is locked. To unlock a worksheet just select this menu function and the check mark by the menu entry will clear as the active worksheet is unlocked for editing.</p>
