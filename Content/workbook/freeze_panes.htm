        <h1>Freeze Panes</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The <b>Format_Freeze Panes</b> menu function enables you to freeze some cells in a worksheet so that they do not scroll when the other cells in the worksheet are scrolled. You might want to do this if you have row and/or column labels in part of a worksheet that you want to keep in view whilst scrolling through data values in the corresponding rows and columns.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If you have a rectangular block of data values that you want to scroll whilst keeping the cells above and to the left of this block frozen in view then click on the top left hand cell of the block and select this menu function.</p>
