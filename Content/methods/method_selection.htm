        <p><u>WARNING</u>
        </p>
        <p>This facility will attempt to find the best test for your data but please remember that it is not a panacea of statistical methodology (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Bland, 1996</a>). If you have any doubt about the best method for your data you should try to consult a statistician and you should most certainly consult a reputable text book.</p>
