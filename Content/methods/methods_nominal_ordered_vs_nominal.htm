        <p><a href="../chi_square_tests/rc.htm">r by c CHI-SQUARE TEST</a>: This is listed under the chi-square section of the analysis menu. Arrange your data in an r by c table. The overall test investigates the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the grouping of r and c. You must ensure that more than 80% of the expected frequencies are &gt; 5, if they are not then you should reduce the number of categories / groups by combination or exclusion.</p>
