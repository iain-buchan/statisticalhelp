        <p>Interval (normal) vs. Nominal (no order)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a href="../analysis_of_variance/one_way.htm">ONE WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE</a>: This is listed under the StatsDirect analysis of variance section. Assumptions are that each group is drawn from a normal distribution and that the variation within the groups is uniform. The F test is fairly robust to small deviations from these assumptions but you could use the Kruskal-Wallis test as a nonparametric alternative if there was any doubt.</p>
