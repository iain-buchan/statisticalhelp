                                        <p>3.1&#160;the Licensor warrants only that testing by the developers to reproduce the results of the examples provided in the electronic documentation has been applied to this Software, including calculations. Other than as aforesaid, the Software is provided "as is" without any other warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor does not warrant that:-</p>
                                        <p>3.1.1&#160;the Software will be error free or that such errors will be corrected. The Licensee is solely responsible for all costs and expenses associated with rectification, repair or damage caused by such errors; and</p>
                                        <p>3.1.2&#160;the Software shall be free from all viruses (although the Licensor has used all reasonable efforts to check for the most commonly known viruses prior to delivery). The Licensee is accordingly solely responsible for virus-scanning the Software;</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>
                                        <p>3.2&#160;the Licensor may create new versions of the Software ("upgrades") which, inter alia, may correct such errors and although the Licensor has no obligation to notify existing Licensees of such upgrades, the same will be made available at the same Internet site from which you downloaded the Software accompanying this Licence;</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>
                                        <p>3.3&#160;the Licensor shall not be liable for any loss or damage whatsoever or howsoever caused arising directly or indirectly in connection with this Licence, the Software, its Use or otherwise, in particular but without prejudice to the foregoing generality as a result of installation or reliance upon the Software or the results of Use of the Software;</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>
                                        <p>3.4&#160;notwithstanding the generality of clause 3.3 above, the Licensor expressly excludes liability for indirect, special, incidental or consequential loss or damage which may arise in respect of the Software howsoever caused even if advised of the possibility of such damages; and</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>
                                        <p>3.5&#160;in the event the Licensor incurs any liability whatsoever, such liability is limited to the licence fee paid by the Licensee for the Software (except for death or personal injury arising from the Licensor's negligence).</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>
                                        <p>4&#160;All copyright, trade marks and other intellectual property rights subsisting in or used in connection with the Software (including but not limited to all images, animations, audio and other identifiable material relating to the Software) are and remain (as between the Licensor and the Licensee) the sole property of the Licensor.</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>

                                        <p>&#160;</p>

                                        <p>&#160;</p>

                                        <p>5.4.1&#160;that other party commits a material breach of this Licence (not being a repudiatory breach of this Licence);</p>
                                        <p>5.4.2&#160;an encumbrancer takes possession or a receiver is appointed over any of the property or assets of that other party;</p>
                                        <p>5.4.3&#160;that other party makes any voluntary arrangement with its creditors or becomes subject to an administration order;</p>
                                        <p>5.4.4&#160;that other party goes into liquidation (except for the purposes of amalgamation or reconstruction and in such manner that the company resulting therefrom effectively agrees to be bound by or assume the obligations imposed on that other party under this Licence);</p>
                                        <p>5.4.5&#160;anything which, under the law of any jurisdiction is analogous to any of the acts or events specified in clauses 5.4.2, 5.4.3 and 5.4.4;</p>
                                        <p>5.4.6&#160;that other party ceases, or threatens to cease, to carry on business.</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>
                                        <p>5.5&#160;For the purposes of clause 5.3, a breach shall be considered capable of remedy if the party in breach can comply with the provision in question in all respects other than as to the time of performance (provided that time of performance is not of the essence).</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>

                                        <p>5.7&#160;Any waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Licence shall not be considered as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of this Licence.</p>
                                        <p>&#160;</p>
                                        <p>5.8&#160;The rights to terminate this Licence given by this clause shall be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of either party in respect of the breach concerned (if any) or any other breach.</p>
