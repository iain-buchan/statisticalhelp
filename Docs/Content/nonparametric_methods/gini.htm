        <p>Menu location: <b>Analysis_Nonparametric_Gini Coefficient of Inequality</b></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This method calculates the Gini coefficient (G) of inequality with bootstrap confidence intervals. A Lorenz plot is produced when a single variable is specified for analysis, otherwise the summary statistics alone are displayed for a group of variables.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Gini coefficient was developed by the Italian Statistician Corrado Gini (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Gini, 1912</a>) as a summary measure of income inequality in society. It is usually associated with the plot of wealth concentration introduced a few years earlier by Max Lorenz (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Lorenz, 1905</a>). Since these measures were introduced, they have been applied to topics other than income and wealth, but mostly within Economics (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Cowell, 1995, 2000; Jenkins, 1991; Sen, 1973</a>).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>G is a measure of inequality, defined as the mean of absolute differences between all pairs of individuals for some measure. The minimum value is 0 when all measurements are equal and the theoretical maximum is 1 for an infinitely large set of observations where all measurements but one has a value of 0, which is the ultimate inequality (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Stuart and Ord, 1994</a>).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When G is based on the Lorenz curve of income distribution, it can be interpreted as the expected income gap between two individuals randomly selected from the population (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Sen, 1973</a>).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The classical definition of G appears in the notation of the theory of relative mean difference:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../GeneratedImages/Equations/Equation153.svg" alt="" class="mcReset" />
        </p>
        <p>- where x is an observed value,  n is the number of values observed and x bar is the mean value.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If the x values are first placed in ascending order, such that each x has rank i, the some of the comparisons above can be avoided and computation is quicker:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../GeneratedImages/Equations/Equation154.svg" alt="" class="mcReset" />
        </p>
        <p>- where x is an observed value, n is the number of values observed and i is the rank of values in ascending order.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note that only positive non-zero values are used.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The small sample variance properties of G are not known, and large sample approximations to the variance of G are poor (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Mills and Zandvakili, 1997; Glasser, 1962; Dixon et al., 1987</a>), therefore confidence intervals are calculated via bootstrap re-sampling methods (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Efron and Tibshirani, 1997</a>).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>StatsDirect calculates two types of bootstrap confidence intervals, these are percentile and bias-corrected (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Mills and Zandvakili, 1997; Dixon et al., 1987; Efron and Tibshirani, 1997</a>). The bias-corrected intervals are most appropriate for most applications.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In order for G to be an unbiased estimate of the true population value, it should be multiplied by n/(n-1) (<a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Dixon, 1987; Mills and Zandvakili, 1997</a>). This corrected form of G does not appear most literature, but there are few situations when it is not the most appropriate form to use.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In the context of measuring inequalities in health, <a href="../references/reference_list.htm">Brown (1994)</a> presents a Gini-style index, seemingly calculated from two variables instead of one. The two variables comprise distinct indicators of health (y, e.g. infant deaths) and population (x, live births) for n groups sorted by a composite measure of health and population (e.g. infant mortality rate).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../GeneratedImages/Equations/Equation155.svg" alt="" class="mcReset" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>G<sub>b</sub> based on two variables (e.g. infant deaths and live births) will be very similar to G calculated from a composite measure (e.g. infant mortality rate). In most situations it is more natural to think of inequality of the composite measure. Another reason not to use G<sub>b</sub> is that its statistical characteristics are not well studied.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>StatsDirect does not provide a separate function to handle distinct health and population variables when calculating Gini coefficients, instead you should use the single composite health/population measure.</p>
